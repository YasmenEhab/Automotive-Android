# Introduction
This README provides an in-depth understanding of various programming concepts essential for embedded systems development. Topics covered include data types, pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and arrays.

## Data Types

### Primitive Data Types
Primitive data types are the basic building blocks for data manipulation in programming. They include:

```c
#int: Represents integer values.
  int a = 10;

# char: Represents single characters.
char b = 'A';

#bool: Represents boolean values (true or false).
bool flag = true;

#void: Represents the absence of type. Commonly used in functions that do not return a value.
void myFunction() {
    // Do something
}
```

## Derived Data Types
Derived data types are built from primitive data types to form more complex data structures.

```c
# Array: A collection of elements of the same type.
int arr[10]; // Array of 10 integers

#Pointer: A variable that stores the address of another variable.
int *p;
```
## User-Defined Data Types
User-defined data types allow programmers to define their own data types.

```c
#typedef: Creates an alias for an existing data type.
typedef unsigned long ulong;

#struct: Groups different types of variables under a single name.
struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
};

#enum: Defines a set of named integer constants.
enum Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE };

#class: Defines a blueprint for objects (applicable in C++ and other object-oriented languages).
class MyClass {
    public:
        int myVar;
        void myMethod() {
            // Method code
        }
};
```

## Pointers
Introduction to Pointers
Pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable. They are a powerful feature in C/C++ that provide flexibility and control over memory manipulation.

```c
int x = 5;
int *p = &x; // 'p' is a pointer to 'x'
```
### Types of Pointers
- Dangling Pointer: A pointer that references a memory location that has been freed/deallocated.
```c
int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
free(ptr); // ptr becomes a dangling pointer
```
- Wild Pointer: A pointer that has not been initialized to a valid memory address.
```c
int *wildPtr; // uninitialized pointer
Void Pointer: A pointer that can hold the address of any data type.

void *vPtr;
int a = 10;
vPtr = &a;
```

- Raw Pointer: A basic pointer without any smart management features (contrast with smart pointers in modern C++).
```c
int *rawPtr = new int(5);
```

## Dynamic Memory Allocation
### Why Avoid Dynamic Memory Allocation in Embedded Systems
- Dynamic memory allocation involves allocating memory during runtime using functions like malloc, calloc, realloc, and free in C. However, in embedded systems, dynamic memory allocation is often avoided for several reasons:

- Predictability: Embedded systems often require real-time performance with strict timing constraints. Dynamic memory allocation can introduce unpredictability due to variable allocation and deallocation times.
- Fragmentation: Frequent allocation and deallocation can lead to memory fragmentation, making it difficult to find contiguous blocks of memory, which can eventually cause allocation failures.
- Limited Memory: Embedded systems typically have limited memory resources. Allocating memory dynamically can lead to inefficient use of these limited resources.
- Determinism: Real-time systems require deterministic behavior. Dynamic memory allocation can disrupt this determinism by introducing non-deterministic delays.
- Instead of dynamic memory allocation, embedded systems often rely on static memory allocation and pre-allocated memory pools to manage memory predictably and efficiently.

## Arrays
Arrays are a fundamental data structure used to store collections of elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations.

Declaring and Initializing Arrays
```c
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
char letters[] = {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'};

#Accessing Array Elements

int firstNumber = numbers[0]; // Access the first element
char firstLetter = letters[0]; // Access the first letter

# Multi-dimensional Arrays
int matrix[3][3] = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};
```
Arrays are widely used in embedded systems for storing sensor data, buffer management, and implementing various algorithms.


## Time Complexity and Space Complexity
- Time Complexity Measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size.
```c
  // Example: O(n) time complexity
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      // some operations
  }
```
- Space Complexity: Measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size.
```c
// Example: O(1) space complexity
int constant_space_function(int n) {
    int x = 0; // only one variable used
    // some operations
    return x;
}
```
## Fragmentation in Dynamic Memory Allocation in C
Fragmentation occurs when memory is allocated and deallocated in a way that leaves small, unusable gaps. This can lead to inefficient use of memory and allocation failures.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

void fragmentation_example() {
    int *p1 = (int *)malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
    free(p1); // p1 is deallocated
    int *p2 = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int)); // smaller block allocated
    // Memory may now be fragmented
}
```
## Garbage Collector and Its Relation with C/C++
- Garbage Collection: An automatic memory management feature in languages like Java and Python, which automatically deallocates unused memory.
- C/C++: Do not have built-in garbage collection. Memory management is manual, requiring explicit allocation (malloc, calloc, realloc) and deallocation (free) in C, and new and delete in C++.

## Strings in C Style and Functions
C-style strings are arrays of characters terminated by a null character ('\0').

```c
#strlen: Computes the length of a string.
#include <string.h>
size_t len = strlen("Hello");

#strcat: Concatenates two strings.
char dest[20] = "Hello";
char src[] = " World";
strcat(dest, src); // dest now contains "Hello World"

#strcpy: Copies one string to another.
char dest[20];
char src[] = "Hello";
strcpy(dest, src); // dest now contains "Hello"

#strcmp: Compares two strings.
int result = strcmp("Hello", "World"); // result is negative because "Hello" < "World"
```
## History of C Standards
- C89/C90 (ANSI C): The first standardized version of C, established in 1989/1990.
- C99: Introduced new features such as inline functions, variable-length arrays, and new data types like long long int.
- C11: Added features like multi-threading support, improved Unicode support, and bounds-checking interfaces.
- C18: The latest standard as of now, mainly addressing defects in C11.

# README: Topics Overview

## How Processors and Compilers Deal with Floating-Point Numbers and Memory Representation

- Floating-point numbers are represented in memory according to the IEEE 754 standard, which defines formats for single (float) and double precision (double) numbers
- Processors utilize specialized hardware (FPU) to perform arithmetic operations on these numbers efficiently. 
- Compilers translate high-level code into machine code that optimally uses these hardware features.

```cpp
// Example of floating-point number representation
float f = 3.14f;
double d = 6.28;

// Compiler optimization for floating-point operations
double result = f * d;
```
## Structs, Enums, and Unions
### Structs
Structs in C and C++ are composite data types that group variables of different types under a single name for efficient memory management and organization.

```cpp
// Example of struct definition
struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float height;
};

// Usage of struct
Person person1;
strcpy(person1.name, "John");
person1.age = 30;
person1.height = 175.5;
```
- Differences Between C and C++ Structs
In C: Structs cannot contain member functions or access specifiers like public or private.

- In C++: Structs and classes are nearly identical, except for the default access level (public for structs).

``` cpp
// Example of C++ struct with member functions
struct Rectangle {
    int length;
    int width;

    // Member function
    int area() {
        return length * width;
    }
};

// Usage of struct with member function
Rectangle rect;
rect.length = 5;
rect.width = 3;
int area = rect.area();
```
- Size of Struct and Padding
The size of a struct is determined by the sum of the sizes of its members, padded to ensure alignment.
- Padding optimizes memory access, especially for structs containing members of different data types.
```cpp
// Example of struct size and padding
struct Example {
    char c;
    int i;
    float f;
};

// Size of struct Example
size_t size = sizeof(Example); // Result depends on padding and alignment
```
## Enums
Enums (Enumerations) define a set of named integral constants, where each constant is assigned a unique value.

```cpp
// Example of enum definition
enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue
};

// Usage of enum
Color c = Green;
```
- Differences Between C and C++ Enums
In C: Enums are limited to integer values and do not have a strict type.

In C++: Enums can be strongly typed, allowing explicit specification of underlying integral type.

```cpp
// Example of C++ enum with underlying type
enum class Status : char {
    Active = 'A',
    Inactive = 'I'
};

// Usage of enum class with underlying type
Status status = Status::Active;
char code = static_cast<char>(status); // Access underlying value
```

## Unions
Unions allow different data types to be stored in the same memory location. Only one member of the union can be active at a time.

```cpp
// Example of union definition
union Data {
    int i;
    float f;
};

// Usage of union
Data data;
data.i = 10;
// Accessing the same memory location as a float
float value = data.f;
```
# C/C++ Building Process Overview

The process of building C/C++ programs involves several stages, each performing specific tasks to convert source code into an executable file. This README outlines these stages and their roles in the compilation and linking process.

## 1. Source File (.cpp) -> Preprocessor -> .I Intermediate File

The journey begins with the source code file (.cpp), which is processed by the preprocessor. The preprocessor performs the following tasks:
- Removes comments and expands macros (#define directives).
- Resolves #include directives to include header files.

The output of the preprocessor is an intermediate file (.I), which contains the modified source code after preprocessing.

## 2. Compiler -> .s/.asm Assembly File -> Frontend

The compiler takes the preprocessed .I file and translates it into assembly code (.s or .asm). This stage is known as the frontend of the compiler and involves:
- Checking syntax and semantics of the code.
- Applying optimizations based on compiler flags (-O0 to -O3 for different optimization levels).

The compiler's output is an assembly file (.s or .asm), which represents the code in a human-readable form before further processing.

## 3. Assembler -> .o/.obj Object File -> Backend

The assembler takes the assembly code (.s or .asm) and converts it into machine-readable binary code. This stage, known as the backend of the compiler, includes:
- Checking syntax again, specifically for architecture-dependent instructions.
- Applying optimizations at the assembly level.
- Generating a symbol table that maps symbols (functions, variables) to their memory addresses.

The output of the assembler is an object file (.o or .obj), which contains machine code and associated metadata.

## 4. Linker -> Output Runnable File

The linker's role is to combine multiple object files (.o or .obj) and libraries into a single executable file or library. Key tasks of the linker include:
- Resolving external references between object files and libraries.
- Merging object code with library code to create a single executable file.
- Generating a symbol table that includes all symbols from the input files.

The output of the linker is a runnable file (executable or shared library) that can be executed directly by the operating system.

## 5. Loader -> Active

The final stage is the loader, which loads the executable file into memory and prepares it for execution. The loader performs the following tasks:
- Allocates memory space for the program and its variables.
- Resolves dynamic linking and addresses for shared libraries.
- Initializes program execution, transferring control to the program's entry point (e.g., main() function).

Once loaded, the program becomes active and executes its instructions as per the compiled code.

This README provides an overview of the C/C++ building process, detailing each stage from source code to executable, highlighting the roles of preprocessing, compilation, assembly, linking, and loading.


# Memory Layout and Functions in C/C++

## Memory Layout

The memory layout of a C/C++ program in RAM is typically divided into several segments, each serving different purposes:

### .bss Segment
- Contains uninitialized global and static variables.
- Memory for these variables is allocated at program startup and initialized to zero.
- Example:
```cpp
  int global_uninit; // Uninitialized global variable
  static int static_uninit; // Uninitialized static variable
```
### .data Segment
Contains initialized global and static variables.
These variables are allocated and initialized at program startup.
Example:
```cpp
int global_init = 42; // Initialized global variable
static int static_init = 42; // Initialized static variable
```
### Stack
Used for local variables, function call arguments, and return addresses.
Grows and shrinks as functions are called and return.
```cpp
void function() {
    int local_var = 0; // Local variable on stack
}
```
###Heap
Used for dynamically allocated memory during program execution.
Managed via malloc, free, new, and delete.
Example:
```cpp
int* dynamic_var = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int)); // Allocate on heap
*dynamic_var = 42;
free(dynamic_var); // Free allocated memory
```
## Functions
- Function Signature
Defines the function's name, return type, and parameters.
Example:
```cpp
int add(int a, int b); // Function signature
```
- Pure Functions
A pure function is deterministic and has no side effects.
Always produces the same output for the same input and does not modify any state or perform I/O.
Example:
```cpp
int square(int x) {
    return x * x; // Pure function
}
```
- Parameter Passing
1. Pass by Value
The function receives a copy of the argument's value.
Changes to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original argument.
Example:
```cpp
void modifyValue(int x) {
    x = 10; // Modifies local copy
}
```
2. Pass by Address
The function receives the address of the argument.
Allows direct modification of the original variable.
Example:
```cpp
void modifyValue(int* x) {
    *x = 10; // Modifies original variable
}
```
3. Pass by Reference (C++)
The function receives a reference to the argument.
Allows direct modification of the original variable with syntax similar to pass by value.
Example:
```cpp
void modifyValue(int& x) {
    x = 10; // Modifies original variable
}
```
- Reentrant vs Non-Reentrant Functions
1. Reentrant Functions
Can be interrupted and safely called again ("re-entered") before the previous executions are complete.
Do not rely on shared or static data and avoid modifying global states.
Example:
```cpp
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive function (reentrant)
}
```
2. Non-Reentrant Functions
Cannot safely be interrupted and re-entered, as they rely on shared or static data.
Example:
```cpp
int counter = 0;
void increment() {
    counter++; // Modifies global state (non-reentrant)
}
```
