# Introduction
This README provides an in-depth understanding of various programming concepts essential for embedded systems development. Topics covered include data types, pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and arrays.

## Data Types

### Primitive Data Types
Primitive data types are the basic building blocks for data manipulation in programming. They include:

```c
#int: Represents integer values.
  int a = 10;

# char: Represents single characters.
char b = 'A';

#bool: Represents boolean values (true or false).
bool flag = true;

#void: Represents the absence of type. Commonly used in functions that do not return a value.
void myFunction() {
    // Do something
}
```

## Derived Data Types
Derived data types are built from primitive data types to form more complex data structures.

```c
# Array: A collection of elements of the same type.
int arr[10]; // Array of 10 integers

#Pointer: A variable that stores the address of another variable.
int *p;
```
## User-Defined Data Types
User-defined data types allow programmers to define their own data types.

```c
#typedef: Creates an alias for an existing data type.
typedef unsigned long ulong;

#struct: Groups different types of variables under a single name.
struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
};

#enum: Defines a set of named integer constants.
enum Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE };

#class: Defines a blueprint for objects (applicable in C++ and other object-oriented languages).
class MyClass {
    public:
        int myVar;
        void myMethod() {
            // Method code
        }
};
```

## Pointers
Introduction to Pointers
Pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable. They are a powerful feature in C/C++ that provide flexibility and control over memory manipulation.

```c
int x = 5;
int *p = &x; // 'p' is a pointer to 'x'
```
### Types of Pointers
- Dangling Pointer: A pointer that references a memory location that has been freed/deallocated.
```c
int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
free(ptr); // ptr becomes a dangling pointer
```
- Wild Pointer: A pointer that has not been initialized to a valid memory address.
```c
int *wildPtr; // uninitialized pointer
Void Pointer: A pointer that can hold the address of any data type.

void *vPtr;
int a = 10;
vPtr = &a;
```

- Raw Pointer: A basic pointer without any smart management features (contrast with smart pointers in modern C++).
```c
int *rawPtr = new int(5);
```

## Dynamic Memory Allocation
### Why Avoid Dynamic Memory Allocation in Embedded Systems
- Dynamic memory allocation involves allocating memory during runtime using functions like malloc, calloc, realloc, and free in C. However, in embedded systems, dynamic memory allocation is often avoided for several reasons:

- Predictability: Embedded systems often require real-time performance with strict timing constraints. Dynamic memory allocation can introduce unpredictability due to variable allocation and deallocation times.
- Fragmentation: Frequent allocation and deallocation can lead to memory fragmentation, making it difficult to find contiguous blocks of memory, which can eventually cause allocation failures.
- Limited Memory: Embedded systems typically have limited memory resources. Allocating memory dynamically can lead to inefficient use of these limited resources.
- Determinism: Real-time systems require deterministic behavior. Dynamic memory allocation can disrupt this determinism by introducing non-deterministic delays.
- Instead of dynamic memory allocation, embedded systems often rely on static memory allocation and pre-allocated memory pools to manage memory predictably and efficiently.

## Arrays
Arrays are a fundamental data structure used to store collections of elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations.

Declaring and Initializing Arrays
```c
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
char letters[] = {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'};

#Accessing Array Elements

int firstNumber = numbers[0]; // Access the first element
char firstLetter = letters[0]; // Access the first letter

# Multi-dimensional Arrays
int matrix[3][3] = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};
```
Arrays are widely used in embedded systems for storing sensor data, buffer management, and implementing various algorithms.


## Time Complexity and Space Complexity
- Time Complexity Measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size.
```c
  // Example: O(n) time complexity
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      // some operations
  }
```
- Space Complexity: Measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size.
```c
// Example: O(1) space complexity
int constant_space_function(int n) {
    int x = 0; // only one variable used
    // some operations
    return x;
}
```
## Fragmentation in Dynamic Memory Allocation in C
Fragmentation occurs when memory is allocated and deallocated in a way that leaves small, unusable gaps. This can lead to inefficient use of memory and allocation failures.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

void fragmentation_example() {
    int *p1 = (int *)malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
    free(p1); // p1 is deallocated
    int *p2 = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int)); // smaller block allocated
    // Memory may now be fragmented
}
```
## Garbage Collector and Its Relation with C/C++
- Garbage Collection: An automatic memory management feature in languages like Java and Python, which automatically deallocates unused memory.
- C/C++: Do not have built-in garbage collection. Memory management is manual, requiring explicit allocation (malloc, calloc, realloc) and deallocation (free) in C, and new and delete in C++.

## Strings in C Style and Functions
C-style strings are arrays of characters terminated by a null character ('\0').

```c
#strlen: Computes the length of a string.
#include <string.h>
size_t len = strlen("Hello");

#strcat: Concatenates two strings.
char dest[20] = "Hello";
char src[] = " World";
strcat(dest, src); // dest now contains "Hello World"

#strcpy: Copies one string to another.
char dest[20];
char src[] = "Hello";
strcpy(dest, src); // dest now contains "Hello"

#strcmp: Compares two strings.
int result = strcmp("Hello", "World"); // result is negative because "Hello" < "World"
```
## History of C Standards
- C89/C90 (ANSI C): The first standardized version of C, established in 1989/1990.
- C99: Introduced new features such as inline functions, variable-length arrays, and new data types like long long int.
- C11: Added features like multi-threading support, improved Unicode support, and bounds-checking interfaces.
- C18: The latest standard as of now, mainly addressing defects in C11.
