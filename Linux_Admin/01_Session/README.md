### Open Source Licenses

Open source licenses are legal frameworks that allow software to be freely used, modified, and shared. They ensure that the software remains open and accessible to everyone. There are various types of open source licenses, each with its own set of permissions and restrictions. Here are some common types:

1. **Permissive Licenses**:
   - **MIT License**: This is a simple and permissive license that allows for reuse within proprietary software provided all copies of the licensed software include the original license.
   - **Apache License 2.0**: This license provides an explicit grant of patent rights from contributors to users. It also allows for the use of the code in proprietary software but requires the inclusion of a copy of the license, a notice of any changes made to the original code, and a statement that the software is provided "as-is" without warranties.

2. **Copyleft Licenses**:
   - **GNU General Public License (GPL)**: This license requires that any modified versions of the software also be open source and distributed under the same GPL license. It ensures that derivative works remain free and open.
   - **GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)**: Similar to the GPL but with fewer restrictions, the LGPL allows developers to link to open source libraries in their proprietary software without having to open source their entire codebase.

3. **Other Notable Licenses**:
   - **BSD License**: There are two main types: the original BSD License and the Modified BSD License (also known as the 3-Clause or New BSD License). Both are permissive licenses but have slightly different terms regarding attribution and endorsements.
   - **Creative Commons Licenses**: While not typically used for software, Creative Commons licenses are often used for other types of creative works. They provide a range of permissions and restrictions to suit various needs.
